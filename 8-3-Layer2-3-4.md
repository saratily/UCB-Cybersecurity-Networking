# 8.3 Following Data Through Layers 2, 3, and 4

## Overview
```
- wireshark
    ARP - layer 2
- ping - layer 3, using ICMP protocol
- fping - range of IP address
- traceroute (tracert) - layer 3, using ICMP protocol
- TCP vs UDP
- Analyze TCP traffic in Wireshark.
- SYN scans - Check available ports - layer 4
```

## Enumeration:
    |_ process to gather data for a specific network
    |_ purpose: find ways to gain access into a network
    |_ STEP:
        |_ Find physical address 
        |_ accessible IPs and ports
        |_ network/network security devices used
    |_ tools used in layer 2,3,4
        |_ ARP - for layer 2

## Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
```
|_ Layer 2: Data Link
    |_ ARP maps MAC -> IP address within the LAN.
    |_ WORKFLOW: 
    Switch -> Broadcast ARP msg -> who has <IP address> 
    <- Machine will respond back with MAC address
    |_ ARP table/cache:
        |_ store dynamic ARP entries, meaning they can be changed with future ARP replies.
        where is soted???
        ARP cache timeout: Dynamic ARP stored for limited time
    |_ ARP should not have 2 machines (MAC address) with same IP, but it is possible
    ISSUES:
        ARP spoofing / ARP cache poisoning:
            |_ attacker send spoof ARP to LAN, directing all traffic (pretending good host)  good host ->  attacker’s MAC address.
            |_ After the attacker sends the spoof ARP, Attacker intercept good host traffic -> attacker’s device 
        e.g. 
            |_ good host = 192.168.47.2; (MAC: 00:50:56:fd:2f:16)
            |_ attacker’s MAC = 00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1. 
            |_ After ARP spoofing, 192.168.47.2 is at 00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1.

        SOLUTION: 
            |_ 1. Wireshark can detect/alert multiple MAC addresses with a samrIP address, however, it will not take any action on its own. 
            |_  Static ARP Entries - permanent IP-to-MAC-address mappings
                |_ expensive
                |_ time consuming
```

### DEMO
Open arp_packets.pcap 
$ wireshark arp_packets.pcap

- Filter by arp or ARP 

- Filter by request only
```
arp.opcode == 1
sample request: Who has <IP address> ? Tell <switch IP address>
e.g. 
No. Time        Source              Destination     Protocol    Length      Info
21	1.324708	VMware_1d:b3:b1	    Broadcast	    ARP 	    42	        Who has 192.168.47.1? Tell 192.168.47.171
Note: 
Date: Seconds since beginning of Capture
      Change it from View -> Time Display Format -> Date and Time of the Day
```

- Filter by response only
```
arp.opcode == 2
sample response: <IP address is at <MAC address> 
No. Time        Source              Destination         Protocol    Length      Info
22	1.324790	VMware_c0:00:08	    VMware_1d:b3:b1	    ARP	        60	    192.168.47.1 is at 00:50:56:c0:00:08
```        

- List all duplicate IP address
```
arp.duplicate-address-detected
In detsils: 
Duplicate IP address detected for 192.168.47.1 (00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1) - also in use by 00:50:56:c0:00:08 (frame 22)
```

### ACTIVITY - Analyzing ARP

1. Open the packet capture provided to you and filter out for ARP activity.
2. Document the physical addresses found for each of the following IP addresses:

-> 192.168.47.1
00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1
00:50:56:c0:00:08

-> 192.168.47.2
00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1
00:50:56:fd:2f:16

-> 192.168.47.200
00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1
00:0c:29:0f:71:a3

-> 192.168.47.254
00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1
00:50:56:f9:f5:54

3. Further analyze the packet capture to determine if these IPs present any potential security vulnerabilities, and write summary of your findings to provide to CompuCorp.
All the above IP address are assigned to 2 MAC address 
It looks like attackers IP address is 00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1, trying to map it will multiple IP addresses

Bonus
4. Name a few ways to protect against this vulnerability.
Creating a static ARP entry in your server.
3rd party tools - to identify/alert potential attacks.

5. Determine the primary vendor for the MAC addresses.

## ping - Packet Inter-network Groper
    |_ Layer 3: Network layer tool, using ICMP protocol
    |_  to determine whether a host is operating and responding to echo requests.
    |_  sends ICMP -> echo request to a specific IP address and waits on a reply
    |_ ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol
    |_ No port info
    |_ firewall might prevent access
        up.edu -> stuck after first response

### fping
    |_ ping on a range of IP addresses in single lne
    e.g. fping -g 101.0.43.10 101.0.43.14

### DEMO 
```
ON terminal in VM Box
$ man ping 
-> Windows also have ping, but that is a bit different

-a -> audible ping
-I -> ping using MAC address
-c n -> limit line count

$ ping -c 4 pepsi.com
PING pepsi.com (45.60.135.51) 56(84) bytes of data.

    ICMP Echo Replies received
        icmp.resp_to  -> 4 rows
    other ICMP received
        icmp.resp_not_found   -> 3 rows
```

## traceroute
    |_ windows -> tracert
    |_ layer 3: Network layer tool, using ICMP protocol
    |_ Optimal routing paths are determined based on the “shortest path,” which is influenced by network topology.
    |_ troubleshoot networking communication issues b/w two devices and determine where the issues are in the hops.
    |_ List all the routes from source to destination
        |_ 1. Display how systems are connected
        |_ 2. Generate baseline -> expected time 
        |_ 3. Diagonose -> identify performace issues
    
### TTL - TimeToLive
    |_ how long a packet will live in a network
    |_ how many hops - Redirection of data transmissions 
    |_ TTL is utilized as a decrementing hop counter.
    |_ Every router that forwards the packet decrements (reduces) the TTL value by on
    e.g. TTL = 3
        HOP A -> TTL = 2
        HOP B -> TTL = 1
        HOP C -> TTL = 0  -> Error: Time Exceeded, if pkt doesnot reach dest
    |_ Default hops: 30, you can customize it by

3. Document a summary of your findings to be provided to CompuCorp using a Traceroute Mapper tool to convey the path of the traffic.

## TCP vs UDP

### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
    |_  “connection-oriented” protocol,server ACK -> received REQUEST from client.
    |_ If no ACK, then pkt lost, resent REQ
    |_ TCP is used with HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, and SMTP
    |_ TCP Hankshake / 3-way Handshake
        |_  est reliable connection to transmit data between devices.
        |_  SETUP:      SYN ->          SYN/ACK <-            ACK ->
        |_ TERMINATION: FIN ->      ACK <-      FIN <-      ACK ->
    |_ Disavd:
        |_ If client/server doesn't receive ACK, retransmission (Overhead)
        |_ ordering of packets can cause delays during data transmissions. 

### User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Datagrams
    |_ when it’s not necessary for all data to reach the destination
    |_  better for reducing latency versus transmitting all data.
    |_ Server: If all the packets are received, great. If not, that's okay too.
    |_ NO handshake

### DEMO
ON terminal in VM Box, Download 3wayhs.pcapng and open in wireshark

List initial SYN traffic
tcp.flags.syn == 1 & tcp.flags.ack == 0

List SYN/ACK traffic (having both in one request)
tcp.flag.syn == 1 & tcp.flags.ack == 1

Expand Transmission Control Protocol, to view src and dest ports

### ACTIVITY - 14_Analyzing_TCP_Traffic
1. Open the packet capture provided and filter out for TCP activity.  New Employee TCP Packet Capture (Resources/packetcapTCPB.pcapng )

2. Find all the TCP handshakes for establishing a connection.
- 3 handshakes 5,6,7 - 8,9,10 - 11,12,13
```
No. Time        Source              Destination     Protocol    Length      Info

```
3. Find any TCP terminations.
```
No. Time        Source              Destination     Protocol    Length      Info

5. Use your findings to determine what the employee is doing during their first week of work.
Hint: Try to determine what websites are being visited.
*Hint:  Try grabbing some of the IPs and researching online what websites they may be connected to
- Additional Hint: Try using websites like https://whatismyip.live/

## SYN SCAN
    |_ layer 4: Transportation layer tool
    |_ check available (state) ports -> open/closed/filtered (block by firewall)
    |_ > enumeration process of sending SYN requests to many ports on a network
    |_ automated s/w program too send SYN requests.
    |_ in response to server AYC/ACK, Client will sent RESET, instead of ACK
    |_ nmap is used for SYN SCAN

### DEMO
ON terminal in VM Box, Download synscandemo.pcapng and open in wireshark
no ack -> port is blocked
tcp.stream.eq.2

sudo nmap -sS -pI 500 stupidmachine.io

All of the SYN requests going from port to port was expected. We knew a SYN scan had
been run by the security manager.
If a SYN scan wasn’t planned, it is unusual network activity that should be looked into.
If a security professional saw this activity, they’d consider using a firewall to block the source IP from scanning the network.
An attacker can use the same SYN scan process for malicious reasons.

### ACTIVITY - 17_Analyzing_SYN_Scan
1. Open the packet capture provided to you.
Resources / synscandemo.pcapng

2. Based on the host responses, determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
3. Write a short summary of your findings.
Note: A general summary of the filtered ports is fine, as the list of filtered ports is large.
